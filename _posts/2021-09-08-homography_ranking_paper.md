# Abstract

*Homography mapping is often exploited to remove perspective distortion in images and can be estimated using point correspondences of a known object (marker). We focus on scenarios with multiple markers placed on the same plane if their relative positions in the world are unknown, causing an indeterminate point correspondence. Existing approaches may only estimate an isolated homography for each marker and cannot determine which homography achieves the best reprojection over the entire image. We thus propose a method to rank isolated homographies obtained from multiple distinct markers to select the best homography. This method extends existing approaches in the post-processing stage, provided that the point correspondences are available and that the markers differ only by similarity transformation after rectification. We demonstrate the robustness of our method using a synthetic dataset and show an approximately 60% relative improvement over the random selection strategy based on the homography estimation from the OpenCV library.*
