&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to share my pipeline that I use for writing research papers and then discussing them with my Ph.D. supervisor. The primary motivation to write this post and to actually implement the described steps in the first place was to make communication with my supervisor who does not use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latex-project.org/&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; as smooth as possible. He also supervised my bachelor’s as well as master’s theses that I wrote using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/sk-sk/microsoft-365/word&quot;&gt;MS Word&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to revision system, our discussions about changes were flawless and the whole process was quick. However, since the beginning of my Ph.D. studies, I have relied solely on LaTeX to write my papers (for obvious reasons) and to produce the final PDF file. Thus, we ended up adding suggestions, comments, and highlights of modifications to the PDF file itself, which was cumbersome. Moreover, little changes in phrasing or just spelling corrections could hardly be caught. This got me thinking whether there was a revision system for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latex-project.org/&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; that provided at least similar capabilities to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/sk-sk/microsoft-365/word&quot;&gt;MS Word&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out, there was such a service as part of paid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.overleaf.com/&quot;&gt;Overleaf&lt;/a&gt; license, but I wanted something free. To this end, I created my own process to circumvent the obstacles of having to highlight changes manually in the PDF file. I managed to resolve the problem of producing &lt;em&gt;diff-like&lt;/em&gt; PDF-file based on LaTeX sources completely free and quickly. With this in mind, the &lt;strong&gt;contribution&lt;/strong&gt; of this tutorial is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I show how to effectively &lt;strong&gt;incorporate &lt;em&gt;diff&lt;/em&gt; mechanism when using&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latex-project.org/&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; (similar to revision system in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/sk-sk/microsoft-365/word&quot;&gt;MS Word&lt;/a&gt;) to easily disseminate the modifications with other people, even with the ones who do not use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latex-project.org/&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; by themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I provide an &lt;strong&gt;example of my personal work pipeline&lt;/strong&gt; for inspiration to see how I approach writing research papers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to assume that the reader is knows how to use LaTeX, either remotely or locally. I think that unless the reader has enough experience with LaTeX, then my motivation and subsequent recommendation would not be fully understood. To make things easier and to actually describe my current work pipeline, I am going to demonstrate the process using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.overleaf.com/&quot;&gt;Overleaf&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.overleaf.com/&quot;&gt;Overleaf&lt;/a&gt; is a perfect tool for remote work, we still need to exploit local applications to produce diffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend the user to install &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;texlive-full&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two tools that we are going to rely on are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexpand&quot;&gt;latexpand&lt;/a&gt; - Latexpand is a Perl script that simply replaces &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\input&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\include&lt;/code&gt; commands with the content of the input or included file.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff&quot;&gt;latexdiff&lt;/a&gt; - Latexdiff is a Perl script for visual mark up and revision of significant differences between two LaTeX files. Various options are available for visual markup using standard LaTeX packages such as color. Changes not directly affecting visible text, for example in formatting commands, are still marked in the LaTeX source. A rudimentary revision facilility is provided by another Perl script, latexrevise, which accepts or rejects all changes. Manual editing of the difference file can be used to override this default behaviour and accept or reject selected changes only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;work-pipeline-demonstration&quot;&gt;Work Pipeline Demonstration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer to separate the contents of the paper into multiple source files. I am a programmer, and I use LaTeX due to its programming-like approach (among other things). I guess a separation of concerns and reduction of coupling are well-established manners that programmers should adhere to all the time. Concerning this, I always (give or take) create the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;main.tex
\sections\introduction.tex
\sections\related_work.tex
\sections\methodology.tex
\sections\experiments.tex
\sections\conclusion.tex
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the structure would change a little from paper the paper, but you get the gist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main file thus contains all these sections included like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-latex highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;\begin{document}&lt;/span&gt;

# Other statements...

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;sections/introduction&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;sections/related&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;work&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;sections/methodology&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;sections/experiments&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;\input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;sections/conclusion&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;\end{document}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I am showing this hierarchy is that in order to produce the &lt;em&gt;diff&lt;/em&gt; file, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;latexdiff&lt;/code&gt; command requires old and new file. However, we now have multiple files, so we will have to merge them prior to finding differences. Just for the record, having to produce a single may also be required for certain publications, so that may one more reason for me to show you a way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;references&quot;&gt;References&lt;/h1&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="tutorial" /><summary type="html">In this post, I show how I approach writing research papers using LaTeX.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Formula for expanding a^n - b^n.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/math/2021/05/04/an_minus_bn_formula.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Formula for expanding a^n - b^n." /><published>2021-05-04T11:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-05-04T11:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/math/2021/05/04/an_minus_bn_formula</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/math/2021/05/04/an_minus_bn_formula.html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I came across the following formula:&lt;/p&gt;

\[a^n - b^n = \left( a - b \right) \left( a^{n - 1} + a^{n - 2}b + a^{n - 3}b^2 + \dots + a^2b^{n - 3} + ab^{n - 1} + b^{n - 1} \right).\]

&lt;p&gt;Or, expressed more compactly:&lt;/p&gt;

\[a^n - b^n = \left( a - b \right) \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} a^{\left( n - 1\right) - k} b^k.\]

&lt;p&gt;My immediate thought was to figure out how someone could have had come up with that formula in the first place. After pondering about it a little bit, I learned about the derivation described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allegedly, one way to derive this expansion is to think about the sum of the geometric series. As a reminder, here we have the well-known formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms of geometric series:&lt;/p&gt;

\[S_n = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \dots + x^{n - 1} + x^{n} = \frac{1 - q^{n + 1}}{1 - q}.\]

&lt;p&gt;The key idea to producing the formula for expanding the expression \(a^n - b^n\) is to derive the formula for the sum of geometric series since it mysteriously involves a similar-looking \(1 - x^n\) term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, let’s start. I will use the standard trick of having the original sum multiplied by \(x\) and subtracted the resulting series from the original. To demonstrate, assume&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;S = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \dots + x^{n - 1},\\

&amp;amp;xS = x + x^2 + x^3 + \dots + x^{n - 1} + x^n.
\end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;Now, subtracting the second equation from the first yields&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;S - Sx = 1 + \left( x - x \right) + \left( x^2 - x^2 \right) + \dots + \left( x^{n - 1} - x^{n - 1} \right) - x^n,\\

&amp;amp;S - Sx = 1 - x^n,\\

&amp;amp;S \left( 1 - x \right) = 1 - x^n.
\end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;When we substitute the value of \(S\) into the last equation, we get&lt;/p&gt;

\[\left( 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \dots + x^{n - 1} \right) \left( 1 - x \right) = 1 - x^n.\]

&lt;p&gt;At this point, our expression starts to become very similar to our ultimate goal stated at the beginning. However, there is still one more substitution to be done before pure algebraic manipulations come into place. Admittedly, I could not come up with this substitution quickly by myself. The truth is, I did not try for too long, but still, I feel that ideas of this type are one of my weaknesses. I reckon it takes a little bit of insight into the problem itself and a good deal of creativity. Nevertheless, for the sake of learning, I consider the solution to be generally applicable. Always keep asking yourself where you want to get in the end, whether it is proving a theorem or just solving a problem. Keep in mind that substitution is a reasonable approach to take. Remember how integration may be simplified using substitution. Speaking of integration, a change in coordinates comes to mind, too. Trigonometric equations are also often tackled with substitution. I remember that I have encountered many times how substitution did the trick. I look at this problem through a similar lens. So, what should we substitute for \(x\), then? Think of it this way. We want to transform the expression \(1 - x^n\) into \(a^n - b^n\). Thus, let’s go with \(x = \frac{b}{a}\), which produces&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{aligned}
\left[ 1 + \frac{b}{a} + {\left( \frac{b}{a} \right) }^2 + {\left( \frac{b}{a} \right) }^3 + \dots + {\left( \frac{b}{a} \right) }^{n - 1} \right] \left( 1 - {\frac{b}{a}} \right) = 1 - {\left( \frac{b}{a} \right) }^n,\\

\left( 1 + \frac{b}{a} + \frac{b^2}{a^2} + \frac{b^3}{a^3} + \dots + \frac{b^{n - 1}}{a^{n - 1}} \right) \left( 1 - {\frac{b}{a}} \right) = 1 - \frac{b^n}{a^n}.\\
\end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;Now, multiply both sides of the last equation by \(a^n\) and further manipulate the equality as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{aligned}
a^n \left( 1 - {\frac{b}{a}} \right) \left( 1 + \frac{b}{a} + \frac{b^2}{a^2} + \frac{b^3}{a^3} + \dots + \frac{b^{n - 1}}{a^{n - 1}} \right) = a^n - b^n,\\

\left( a^n - a^{n - 1}b \right) \left( 1 + \frac{b}{a} + \frac{b^2}{a^2} + \frac{b^3}{a^3} + \dots + \frac{b^{n - 1}}{a^{n - 1}} \right) = a^n - b^n,\\

a^{n - 1} \left( a - b \right) \left( 1 + \frac{b}{a} + \frac{b^2}{a^2} + \frac{b^3}{a^3} + \dots + \frac{b^{n - 1}}{a^{n - 1}} \right) = a^n - b^n,\\

\left( a - b \right) a^{n - 1}  \left( 1 + \frac{b}{a} + \frac{b^2}{a^2} + \frac{b^3}{a^3} + \dots + \frac{b^{n - 1}}{a^{n - 1}} \right) = a^n - b^n,\\

\left( a - b \right)  \left( a^{n - 1} + a^{n - 1}\frac{b}{a} + a^{n - 1}\frac{b^2}{a^2} + a^{n - 1}\frac{b^3}{a^3} + \dots + a^{n - 1}\frac{b^{n - 1}}{a^{n - 1}} \right) = a^n - b^n,\\

\left( a - b \right)  \left( a^{n - 1} + a^{n - 2}b + a^{n - 3}b^2 + a^{n - 4}b^3 + \dots + b^{n - 1} \right) = a^n - b^n.\\
\end{aligned}\]

&lt;p&gt;This problem reminds me of one talk by Simon Sinek regarding how people cannot ignore the negative (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W05FYkqv7hM&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;). Let me elaborate. He started to talk by showing that people cannot avoid thinking of an elephant when told: “&lt;em&gt;do not think of an elephant&lt;/em&gt;.” Later on, he expanded on this idea by discussing how skiers should not focus on “&lt;em&gt;not hitting the trees&lt;/em&gt;” but they should focus on “staying on the path.” In essence, I have encountered something similar with this problem as well. Just focusing on where I want to get in the end seems to be sufficient to guide me through the whole derivation of this formula. I do hope I will be able to recreate this in several months without brushing up!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="math" /><summary type="html">In this post, I show how to derive a formula for expanding a^n - b^n.</summary></entry></feed>
